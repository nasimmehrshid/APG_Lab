## Exercise 1: [Data ingestion](<./Exercise1.md>)
At this exercise you connect to different data sources (CSV,AzureSQL database) and create a pipeline to move data into a centralized data lake. No transformation over data is required. The solution should cover delta load for big tables.  
Task 1: [Create a raw zone in your ADLSG2](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG-Demo/blob/main/Exercise%201.md#task-1-create-a-raw-zone-in-your-adlsg2>)

Task2: [Create a link from Synapse to Purview](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG-Demo/blob/main/Exercise%201.md#task-2-create-a-link-from-synapse-to-purview>)

Task3: [Create a Synapse pipeline with a Copy Activity](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG-Demo/blob/main/Exercise%201.md#task-3-create-a-synapse-pipeline-with-a-copy-activity>)

Task4: [Copy data from Blob Storage to Azure SQL DB](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG-Demo/blob/main/Exercise%201.md#task-4copy-data-from-blob-storage-to-azure-sql-db>)

Task5: [Visualize the Data Lineage in Purview](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG-Demo/blob/main/Exercise%201.md#task5-visualize-the-data-lineage-in-purview>)

Task6: [Create a raw zone in your ADLSG2](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG-Demo/blob/main/Exercise%201.md#task-6-create-a-raw-zone-in-your-adlsg2>)

Task 7: [Create copy pipeline](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG-Demo/blob/main/Exercise%201.md#task-7-create-copy-pipeline>)  

Task 8: [Run your pipeline and monitor](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG-Demo/blob/main/Exercise%201.md#task-8-run-your-pipeline-and-monitor>)
## Exercise 2: [Unpivot with Synapse Data Flow Data Flow](<./Exercise3.md>) 
## Exercise 3: [Data preparation and transformation](<./Exercise 4.md>) 
At this exercise you get to explore different flavors of Synapse runtime. Do ad-hoc data wrangling and use Azure Synapse Lake databse patterns.  
Task 1: [Data quality checks](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG_Lab/blob/main/Exercise%204.md#task-1-data-quality-checks>)  
Task 2: [Create Lake database](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG_Lab/blob/main/Exercise%204.md#task-2-create-lake-database>)  
## Exercise 4: [Datawarehouse ](<./Exercise 5.md>)  
At this exercise you work on designing Datawarehouse schema. You investigate what Azure Synapse offers in terms of indexing and partitioning and pipeline design.    
Task 1: [Determine table category](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG_Lab/blob/main/Exercise%205.md#task-1-determine-table-category>)  
Task 2: [Create Dedicated SQL pool and star schema](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG_Lab/blob/main/Exercise%205.md#task-2-create-dedicated-sql-pool-and-star-schema>)  
Task 3: [Populate data warehouse tables with Spark pool](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG_Lab/blob/main/Exercise%205.md#task-3-populate-data-warehouse-tables-with-spark-pool>)  
Task 4: [Populate data warehouse tables with Dataflow](<https://github.com/nasimmehrshid/APG_Lab/blob/main/Exercise%205.md#task-4-populate-data-warehouse-tables-with-dataflow>)
